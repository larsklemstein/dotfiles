# dotfiles
Profiles for bash and/or ksh and some other stuff.


## Goals

1. have a single source for all Linux accounts using bash and/or ksh
2. strictly follow the login vs. nologin *and* interactive/non-interactive approach
3. easy way to link local and potential private data

4. stupid install.bash


## Remarks

None so far.
